## Web Application Firewalls (WAF)

<p align="justify">Is a security solution specifically designed to protect web applications from various types of attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and application-layer DDoS attacks. It focuses on the <b>application layer</b> of the network stack and is typically deployed in front of web servers to filter and monitor incoming and outgoing HTTP/HTTPS traffic

## Types of Web Application Firewalls

There are three primary ways to implement a WAF:

- Network-based (NWAF): Traditionally hardware-based in an on-premises environment.

- Host-based: WAF is implemented as an additional application or plugin on a web server.

- Cloud-based: WAF protection is transferred to an external cloud supplier.

<!-- ## How does a WAF work?

A WAF is usually placed logically between users and web servers and analyzes and compares network traffic with the vulnerability database. A WAF creates a set of rules designed to protect your website and detects unwanted traffic. It usually blocks this traffic but can be set up to only monitor it. -->
