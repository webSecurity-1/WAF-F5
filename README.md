## Web Application Firewalls (WAF)

<p align="justify">Is a security solution specifically designed to protect web applications from various types of attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and application-layer DDoS attacks. It focuses on the <b>application layer</b> of the network stack and is typically deployed in front of web servers to filter and monitor incoming and outgoing HTTP/HTTPS traffic

## Types of WAF

There are three primary ways to implement a WAF:

- Network-based (NWAF): Traditionally hardware-based in an on-premises environment.

- Host-based: WAF is implemented as an additional application or plugin on a web server.

- Cloud-based: WAF protection is transferred to an external cloud supplier.

## WAF Detection Methods
<p align="justify">
A Web Application Firewall (WAF) detects abnormal behavior by analyzing the incoming traffic to a web application and comparing it against predefined security rules and patterns. Here are some common methods used by WAFs to detect abnormal behavior:
</p>

- Signature-based detection

- Regex-based detection

- Challenge/Response detection (virusTotal)

- Abnormal Behaviors detection

<p align="justify">
It's important to note that WAFs use a combination of these methods to provide comprehensive protection. The specific techniques and algorithms employed may vary depending on the WAF vendor and its capabilities.
